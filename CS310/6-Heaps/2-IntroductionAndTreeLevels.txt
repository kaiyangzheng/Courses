// Introduction and Tree Levels

/*
Heap
- parent is > child - max heap
- parent is < child - min heap

- in any Tree
    - 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 15 n (items)
    - 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 level
    - 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 height
    - 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 log2 (n+1)-1

- Thus, if we know how many elements are in the tree, we can calculate the levels
