/*
Adding to a heap
- add to next available space
- heap violation if child is bigger than parent
    - Solution: swap parent and child
    - swap continuously until no heap violation
- Add: 
    - insert next available space
    - trickle up

Remove from a heap
- always remove the root
- remove last element in the tree and insert into root Node
- heap violation is created
    - swap root with children until it finds a resting place where its smaller than parent and bigger than children
- Remove:
    - remove the root
    - replace w/ last element 
    - trickle down
        - swap with larger of two children
