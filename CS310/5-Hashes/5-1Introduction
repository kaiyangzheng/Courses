Problem with Linked List
- Finding an element - O(n)
- How to find O(1)?

Hashes
- add
- remove
- lookup/find/contains
- change
- O(?)

All entries
- all keys
- all values
- Theta(n) - at least n amount of work

size
- isEmpty
- isFull
- loadFactor()
- O(1)

cssc010 => 92% - 10
cssc011 => 100% - 11
cssc012 => 65% - 12
cssc013 => 93% - 13

Want to create a data structure that can take an id => number => data
- originally started as Associated arrays

make two arrays
- Array number 1 - student id - key
- Array number 2 - grade - value

hashCode(String id)
    remove cssc
    convert to int
    int - 10
- hash function
- many ways to write hash functions

Now, to find grade associated with value
- go to position associated with number - O(1)
- get the value out
- find and remove is constant time 
- remove - change value from id to -1 or null
