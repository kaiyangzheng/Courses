/*
Hash functions
- property of the data
- be fast to compute
- if two things are "equal" should return the same value
- always return the same value during one run of the code
- possible to return different values for an object in separate runs
- minimize collisions

Object 
- few methods to override
- toString
- equals
- hashCode
