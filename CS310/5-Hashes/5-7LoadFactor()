// LoadFactor()
// 6/6/22

/*
load factor - how much data we have in our table
- as we add elements, we need to know how full the array is relative to its size
- load factor - lambda: number of entries/total size of the array
    - allows us to quickly assert how full the array is 
        - 0 - empty, 0.5 - half, 1 - full
    - as lamba reaches 0.6 or 0.7, need to consider resizing the table
