Trees
- smaller things are on the left

LinkedList
- pointer: next, object: data
- can be expanded to include
    - left
    - data
    - right
- Tree - same concept as LinkedList 
    - use of inner class Node

class Node<E>{
    E data;
    Node<E> right;
    Node<E> left;

    public Node(E obj){
        this.data = obj;
        left = null;
        right = null;
    }
}
- sometimes, Node can have parent Node 
    - this way, child can have a pointer to its parent
