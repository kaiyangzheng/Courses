int i = 10; - how much memory does i take?
- short: 2 bytes
- long: 8 bytes

Student s = new Student(); - how much memory does s take?
- depends on OS
- JVM takes 4 bytes for s, which point to a space on the heap that are used to store whatever is in the Student class

class Person
- id
- name
- email

class Student
- gpa
- classes

class Undergraduate
- year

Class Declarations
- public class Person{}
- public class Student extends Person{}
- public class Undergraduate extends Student{}

Casting
- Undergraduate u = new Undergraduate();
    - 4 bytes on the heap
    - takes all variables for Undergraduate, Student, and Person
- Student s = new Undergraduate();
    - space allocated for Undergraduate object
- Cannot say Undergraduate u = new Student(); - space for Student, but more variables/methods needed for Undergraduate
