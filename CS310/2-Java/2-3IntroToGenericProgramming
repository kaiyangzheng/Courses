- How can I use this sorting method for Strings - without generic programming?
    - Change everything to String

Goal of Geneic Programming - allow every type to be used in a method
- Obj .equals() - compares memory location 
    - override .equals() method
- Obj .toString()
    - override .toString() method
- Obj .hashCode()

Object[] arr = new Object[10];
Student s = new Student;
Object obj = s;
arr[0] = obj;

Monkey m = new Monkey();
arr[1] = m;

String s= "Chalk and Cheese";
arr[2] = s;

Will this all compile?
- Yes, they are all Objects
- However, not pleasing - mixing up different types
- Solution? - Parameterized Types - allow us to define what to put in a particular container
