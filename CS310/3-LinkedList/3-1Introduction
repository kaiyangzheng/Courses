/*
Node
- 2 pieces of information
    - pointer
    - data

Linked List
- Many nodes, eaching containing a pointer and piece of data
    - each pointer points to a place in memory - the adjacent node
    - Node A => Node B => Node C => Node D => null
- Start our list with a pointer - head - points to first Node in the list
- Only way to access data in LinkedList is through the head 
    - next = head.next => Node B
    - data = head.data
    - head.next.next
    - head.next.data
