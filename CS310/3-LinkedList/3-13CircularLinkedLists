// Circular Linked Lists
// 6/3/22

/*
How to tell if my Linked List was a circular Linked List?
- interate until temporary pointer is null
- iterate until temporary pointer is same as head
- interate until temporary pointer.next is the same as head

if Tail pointer
- check of tail.next = head;

What if tail points to middle of the list?
- if tail.next != null;

if no tail
- create two temporary pointers that go through list to see if the start repeats
- Complexity O(n^2)
