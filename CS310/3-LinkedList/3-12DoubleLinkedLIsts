/*
Problem with Singly Linked List
- even with a Tail pointer, removeLast() is always O(n)
- no way to go from last element to thing beofre
- Solution: Doubly Linked List

Doubly Linked List
- each Node: next, previous, data
- next points to next Node, previous points to previous Node

Now, to do removeLast()

E temp = tail.data;
Node<E> beforeLast = tail.prev;
tail.prev.next = null;
tail = tail.prev

Advantage - constant time remove
